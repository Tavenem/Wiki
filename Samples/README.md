# NeverFoundry.Wiki.Samples
This section contains four projects:
* `NeverFoundry.Wiki.Samples.Shared`, which provides common classes and styles for all sample
  projects.
* `NeverFoundry.Wiki.Samples.Simple`, a bare-bones example with the minimum required code for a
  `NeverFoundry.Wiki.Mvc` wiki. This sample is intended for those who wish to see the wiki up and
  running with a minimum of fuss.
* `NeverFoundry.Wiki.Samples.Complete`, a full-featured example project which uses
  [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to launch a database, search client, monitoring tools, and an MVC
  wiki site.
* `NeverFoundry.Wiki.Samples.Cosmos`, a modification of the simple example which uses the [Azure
  Cosmos Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) to demonstrate
  the ability to use a cloud backing store for the wiki, without actually requiring any provisioned
  cloud resources.

# NeverFoundry.Wiki.Samples.Simple
This project is a modification of the simple example which uses the [Azure Cosmos
Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) to demonstrate the
ability to use a cloud backing store for the wiki, without actually requiring any provisioned cloud
resources.
